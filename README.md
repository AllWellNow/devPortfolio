# iOS Developer Portfolio
Hi! I'm Misha and I'm a Sowtware developer. This is my iOS portfolio :)

The structure of this portfolio is a list of the projects I've done during my path through coding. I'm also adding short descriptions, technologies used, and extra notes to some projects in this list.

## Hungry - an Intermittent Fasting App

Hungry helps you to lose weight in the most efficient way - intermittent (or interval) fasting. Some of the core possibilities of the app are:
<ul>
  <li>Fasting Tracker - choose your interval and track fasting and eating period</li>
  <li>Weight Tracker - set starting and goal weight, update current weight and track progress to chosen goal. Weight changes also available in a form of a Chart and a Progress Table</li>
  <li>Water Tracker - set daily water goal and track your consumption, water progress resets every day</li>
  <li>Challenges - choose the one you like, pick a period for it, and try to complete it. Give up option included</li>
  <li>Leveling system - to earn levels and unlock new titles simply use the app - stay in chosen fasting period, track water, complete challenges, etc. </li>
  </ul>

Design was applied with Storyboards, Auto-Layout and programmaticaly 

#### 💡 Notes
This one is the current flagman solo-developed project of mine available on the AppStore. The app requires no account creation to use it, also it's totally free, no paid features included. 
The idea was to create a user-friendly fasting app with all the necessary functions plus some extra ones and make it free to easen the fasting process for the newcomers
