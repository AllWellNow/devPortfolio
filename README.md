# iOS Developer Portfolio
Hi! I'm Misha, a junior iOS developer. Welcome to my portfolio :)

Structure of this portfolio is a list of the projects I've done during my path through coding. I'm also adding short description, technologies used and some extra notes to every project in this list.

## Hungry - an Intermittent Fasting App

Hungry helps you to lose weight in a most efficient way - intermittent (or interval) fasting. Some of the core possibilities of the app are:
<ul>
  <li>Fasting Tracker - choose your interval and track fasting and eating period</li>
  <li>Weight Tracker - set starting and goal weight, update current weight and track progress to chosen goal. Weight changes also available in a form of a Chart and a Progress Table</li>
  <li>Water Tracker - set daily water goal and track your consumption, water progress resets every day</li>
  <li>Challenges - choose the one you like, pick a period for it, and try to complete it. Give up option included</li>
  <li>Leveling system - to earn levels and unlock new titles simply use the app - stay in chosen fasting period, track water, complete challenges, etc. </li>
  </ul>

#### 💡 Notes
This one is the current flagman project of mine. The app requires no account creation to use it, also it's totally free, no paid features included. 
The idea was to create user-friendly fasting app with all the necessary functions plus some extra ones and make it free to easen the fasting process for the newcomers
